# Basic-C-programs

1. Write a C Program to authenticate a user using username and password. Have a list of 5 usernames and passwords in an array. If the entered username and password matches with the username / password combination in the array, then print as “Authentication Successful” else print “Authentication failed , try again”. The user is permitted to enter the wrong password only 3 times. If the user exceeds the limit, then print “Limit exceeded. Try later”.

2. Write a C program to create a password strength meter. A password is said to be strong if it is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one lowercase character, one uppercase character, one special character ( !@#$%^&*()) and one digit. The program should obtain a password string from the user and compute the password strength (in percentage) based on the 5 criteria listed above for strong passwords.

3. Write a C program to generate strong passwords of a length specified by the user.
